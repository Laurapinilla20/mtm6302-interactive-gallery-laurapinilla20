Interactive Gallery: Magical Nature Landscapes
Student: Laura Marcela Pinilla Ramirez
ID: 41117232

This project is an interactive image gallery that showcases stunning images of nature. The gallery dynamically loads images and allows users to click on an image to view a larger version along with a description. The images are from Unsplash, a platform offering high-quality, royalty-free images.

Project Overview

The gallery displays 12 beautiful images related to nature, landscapes, and the environment. Each image is clickable, and upon clicking, a modal appears with a larger version of the image along with a title and brief description. The modal can be closed by clicking anywhere outside the image.

Key Features:
- **Dynamic Image Gallery**: 12 images are displayed dynamically in a grid layout, with titles and descriptions displayed in the modal.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, displaying images in a grid of 4 columns on desktop and 2 columns on mobile.
- **Image Modal**: When an image is clicked, a larger version of the image is shown along with a description. Clicking the large image hides it.
- **Event Delegation**: All event handling is done through event listeners, utilizing event delegation for handling clicks on the images.

Technology Used
- **HTML**: The structure and content of the page.
- **CSS**: The layout and styling, including Flexbox for the grid and modal layout.
- **JavaScript**: The logic for dynamically loading the images, handling clicks, and managing the modal view.
  
Gallery Layout:
- On **desktop** screens, the gallery shows **4 columns**.
- On **mobile** devices, the gallery displays **2 columns**, and the modal displays the image at the top with the description below.

Mobile View:
On smaller screens (below 768px), the layout adjusts to 2 columns for the gallery and stacks the image and description vertically when viewing the modal.
